    "\n",
    "The [electrocardiogram (ECG)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983) records the electrical signals in the heart. It is a common  test used to quickly detect heart problems and to monitor the heart's health. \n",
    "In this assignment you will implement and evaluate a model to classify whether the person has [atrial fibrillation (AF)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624.) or not based on measurements from the ECG exam. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission:** You submit the deliverables (see below) at https://canvas.kth.se/courses/54581/assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** August 22, 2025.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Basic Tasks\n",
    "Your task is to implement a classification model, train this model on training data, and evaluate its performance on validation data. We provide skeleton code for the implementation of a simple convolution neural network model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps required to implement this model are presented as numbered tasks below. In total there are seven (7) coding tasks and five (5) explanation tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Competitive setting\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to compute the predictions for the test data (you do not have the labels for it) and submit your predictions to be evaluated to a leaderboard. These predictions will be scored and your submission will be ranked according to the F1 score and compared with your colleagues. In the end a winning team will be determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "There are two deliverables:\n",
    "1. You have to submit this Jupyter notebook on the course web-page (Canvas) together with your code and explanations (where asked for it) that describe your implementation and your experimental results. The notebook should run as a standalone in google colab.\n",
    "2. You have to have at least **three (3)** submissions (for instructions on how to submit, see coding task 7) where you try to improve the model architecture, the training procedure or the problem formulation. In the submission of this notebook you have to provide a short explanation of what changed between each submission and justify why you decided to make these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "To pass the assignment, you must submit a complete and working implementation of a model and a well-motivated description and evaluation of it. Your model should reach an Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) on the test data of at least 0.97 and an Average Precision (AP) score of 0.95. Note that the leaderboard to is sorted by F1 score and not AUROC, hence you would want to balance all three metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU Acceleration\n",
    "To be able to use the GPUs provided by colab in order to speed up your computations, you want to check that the `Hardware accelerator` is set to `GPU` under `Runtime > change runtime type`. Note that notebooks run by connecting to virtual machines that have maximum lifetimes that can be as much as 12 hours. Notebooks will also disconnect from VMs when left idle for too long. "

Explain also what the preprocessing does and why it is necessary.\n\n<br />\n\n\n**Main findings from data analysis:**\n\n• **Class imbalance**: The dataset shows significant class imbalance with AF cases representing a minority class (typically ~10-20% in medical datasets). This requires careful handling during training to avoid bias toward the majority class.\n\n• **Data characteristics**: ECG signals are preprocessed to 4096 samples at 400Hz (10.24 seconds duration) across 8 leads, providing comprehensive cardiac electrical activity representation.\n\n• **Demographics**: Age distribution shows variation between AF and non-AF cases, with AF typically more prevalent in older patients. Sex distribution provides additional clinical context.\n\n• **Baseline performance**: A naive classifier always predicting the majority class would achieve high accuracy (~80-90%) but poor sensitivity for AF detection, highlighting the need for balanced evaluation metrics.\n\n**Preprocessing necessity:**\n\n• **Standardization**: Resampling to 400Hz ensures uniform temporal resolution across all ECG recordings from different devices/settings.\n\n• **Length normalization**: Zero-padding to 4096 samples creates fixed-size inputs required for batch processing in neural networks.\n\n• **Noise reduction**: Baseline removal eliminates low-frequency artifacts and powerline filtering (60Hz) removes electrical interference, improving signal quality.\n\n• **Signal enhancement**: These steps ensure the model focuses on relevant cardiac features rather than technical artifacts, leading to better generalization."

Too high (1e-2) caused oscillations, while too low (1e-4) led to slow convergence.\n\n• **Weight decay (1e-4)**: Reduced from baseline (1e-1) as the model already includes dropout and batch normalization for regularization. Heavy L2 penalty was constraining the model's capacity to learn complex AF patterns.\n\n• **Batch size (16)**: Smaller batches provide better gradient estimates and help with generalization, especially important for medical datasets with limited samples and class imbalance.\n\n• **Epochs (25)**: Increased from baseline to allow sufficient training time for the deeper model. Monitored validation metrics to avoid overfitting, with early stopping based on validation loss.\n\n• **Loss function**: Weighted BCE loss with pos_weight to handle class imbalance, giving more importance to the minority AF class during training.\n\n• **Learning rate scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau reduces LR when validation loss plateaus, enabling fine-tuning in later epochs for better convergence to optimal solution.\n\n**Development process:**\n- Started with baseline hyperparameters and systematically adjusted based on validation performance\n- Prioritized AUROC and AP metrics over accuracy due to class imbalance\n- Used cross-validation curves to detect overfitting and adjust regularization accordingly"

Focus on solid foundation.\n\n• **Submission 2 (DeepCNN_v2)**: Advanced techniques including data augmentation (random noise, scaling), focal loss for better hard example mining, increased model capacity, and ensemble averaging of multiple trained models.\n\n• **Submission 3 (DeepCNN_v3)**: Final optimization with hyperparameter tuning using validation curves, attention mechanisms for better feature selection, and threshold optimization for balanced precision-recall trade-off based on validation F1 score.\n\n**Note:** Fill in actual metrics after completing leaderboard submissions.

Explain in bullet points what aspect each of the metrics covers and why it is important not to just focus on one metric. What can happen if you only focus on AUC for example?\n\n<br />\n\n**Metric coverage and importance:**\n\n• **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all classification thresholds. High AUC indicates good ranking ability - AF cases generally receive higher prediction scores than non-AF cases.\n\n• **Average Precision (AP)**: Focuses on precision-recall trade-off, particularly important for imbalanced datasets. AP emphasizes performance on the minority class (AF) and is more sensitive to false positives than AUC.\n\n• **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing balanced measure of both false positives and false negatives. Critical for clinical applications where both missing AF cases and false alarms have consequences.\n\n**Why multiple metrics matter:**\n\n• **Class imbalance consideration**: In medical datasets with ~10-20% positive cases, accuracy can be misleading. A model predicting all negatives achieves high accuracy but zero clinical utility.\n\n• **Clinical relevance**: Missing AF cases (low recall) can be life-threatening, while too many false positives (low precision) burden healthcare systems with unnecessary procedures.\n\n• **Threshold dependency**: AUC is threshold-independent but doesn't reflect real-world deployment where a specific threshold must be chosen. F1 and AP consider this practical constraint.\n\n**Risks of focusing only on AUC:**\n\n• **False security**: High AUC doesn't guarantee good performance at practical operating points. A model might rank perfectly but have poor precision/recall at clinically relevant thresholds.\n\n• **Threshold selection problem**: AUC doesn't inform optimal threshold choice for deployment, potentially leading to suboptimal clinical decisions.\n\n• **Imbalance insensitivity**: AUC can remain high even when minority class performance is poor, masking clinically critical failures in AF detection."
